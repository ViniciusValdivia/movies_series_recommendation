# Project description
This project aims to recommend movies or series based on a choice (suggestion) of a reference title.

In this first version, the recommendation will be based on the genre(s) of the suggestion.

During the presentation of the codes there are detailed explanations about each of the stages of the project



# Conclusion
carrying out the project was fun and challenging.

In this first version, the recommendations were based only on gender(s), and we know that there are other factors that can also be used for recommendation, which are actresses, actors and directors.

At some point for a second version, with the necessary corrections, it is possible to create new lists of recommendations based on other characteristics.

Hope you like the project result and send me a message about recommending your suggestions. Do you agree with the result? And if you find any errors or want to make a comment, please let me know!
